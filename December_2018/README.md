# Knowledge Gaps - December 2018

Read more about this months project [here](https://www.vizsimply.com/blog/knowledgegaps-building-a-slope-chart-with-d3).

My approach this month was to learn how to implement D3 in VueJS. This code repo is by no means an expert overview of how to integrate Vue and D3. Therefore I'm open for any suggestions and tips & tricks.

## Project setup

```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development

```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production

```
npm run build
```
